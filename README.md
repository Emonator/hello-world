I remember I remember the house where I was born
The little window where the sun came peeping in at morn
He never came a wink too soon, or brought too long a day;
But now I often wish the night had borne my breath away.รถ

I remember I remember where I was used to swing
And thought the air must rush as fresh to swallows on the wing
My spirit flew in feathers then that is so heavy now
And summer pools could hardly cool the fever on my brow
